# Face Recognition using OpenCV

## Overview
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and Python.
It detects and recognizes faces through a webcam using the LBPH algorithm.

## Features
- Real-time face detection
- Face recognition with confidence score
- Webcam-based live recognition
- Custom dataset training

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Folder Structure

├── person1/
├── person2/

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the project
   python recognize.py

## Output
- Green bounding box around detected face
- Name and confidence displayed

## Dataset
