# Face Recognition using OpenCV

## Overview
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and Python.
It detects and recognizes faces through a webcam using the LBPH algorithm.

## Features
- Real-time face detection
- Face recognition with confidence score
- Webcam-based live recognition
- Custom dataset training

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Folder Structure
dataset/
├── person1/
├── person2/

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the project
   python recognize.py

## Output
- Green bounding box around detected face
- Name and confidence displayed

## Dataset
Dataset sourced from AT&T Face Database / Kaggle (for educational use)

▶️ How to Open & Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the face recognition system on your local machine.

🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Sanjayarjun/Face-Recognition-OpenCV.git

🔹 Step 2: Navigate to Project Folder
cd Face-Recognition-OpenCV

🔹 Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 Step 4: Run the Face Recognition Program
python recognize.py

🔹 Step 5: Camera Activation

The webcam will turn ON automatically

Faces will be detected in real-time

A green bounding box will appear around the face

Person name and confidence score will be displayed

🔹 Step 6: Exit the Application

Press Q or ESC to close the camera window safely

⚠️ Notes

Ensure your camera is not being used by another application

Good lighting improves recognition accuracy

Run the program from Anaconda Prompt / Terminal

Internet connection is not required after setup

✅ Expected Output

Real-time face detection

Face recognition with confidence score

Smooth webcam performance
